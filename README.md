## ðŸŒ€ Image Rotator â€“ Simple Chrome Extension

Image Rotator is a minimal Chrome extension that allows you to rotate any image on a webpage directly in the browser. This is especially handy when you're comparing product images, like spare parts, and need to match angles visually.

While there are existing solutions in the Chrome Web Store, many of them require broad permissions. This extension was created as a lightweight and privacy-respecting alternative â€“ and as a quick experiment in AI-assisted coding.

Built in under 5 minutes using a carefully crafted AI prompt and pushed straight to GitHub.

## ðŸ”§ Features
